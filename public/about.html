    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>Over the past 40 years I have had various careers in wildly different field such as medical physics, health, airlines,
    hospitality and operations management. Now it is time, once again for me to make a career change to keep myself
    challenged.</p>

    <p>In high-school in the early 80's paleolithic period I learned to program in BASIC and had a lot of fun with it.</p>

    <p>In the 90’s I started learning html, when websites were still very basic and everything was new. I found it quite
    enjoyable but, at the time, I didn’t see myself making a career out of it (oh! if I only knew then!). Work commitments
    at the time meant that I was unable to pursue my learning as I focused on my current career and I left website design
    behind.</p>

    <p>Recently I left a career that was no longer exciting me and was just becoming tedious and draining. After some time off
    and speaking to some younger friends working in the field I decided it might be time to revisit the possibility of a
    career in web development.</p>

    <p>I really enjoy travel so having a career that can "travel with me" would be awesome.</p>

    <p>I’m sure that the learning curve will be quite steep but I do love giving myself new challenges so this is the first
    step.</p>
